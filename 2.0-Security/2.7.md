## ‚úÖ Objective 2.7 ‚Äì Apply Workstation Security Options and Hardening Techniques

### üéØ Introduction

This section covers **Objective 2.7** of the **CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1202)** exam. IT professionals must understand how to secure workstations by configuring settings, applying encryption, and following best practices for system hardening.

## üîê Workstation Security & Hardening Techniques

### 1. Data-at-Rest Encryption
- Encrypt stored data to protect sensitive information if the device is lost or stolen.
- Examples:
  - **BitLocker** (Windows)
  - **FileVault** (macOS)
  - Full-disk encryption on laptops and removable drives.

### 2. Password Considerations
| Consideration | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Length** | Use long passwords (at least 12 characters recommended). |
| **Character Types** | Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. |
| **Uniqueness** | Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts. |
| **Complexity** | Ensure passwords are not easily guessable or dictionary words. |
| **Expiration** | Change passwords regularly to reduce risk of compromise. |

### 3. BIOS / UEFI Passwords
- Set passwords at the firmware level to prevent unauthorized booting or changes to boot order.
- Protect access to system firmware settings and prevent unauthorized OS installation.

### 4. End-User Best Practices
- Use **screensaver locks** with passwords after inactivity.
- **Log off** when leaving the workstation.
- **Physically secure** laptops and critical hardware.
- Protect **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and credentials.
- Use **password managers** to safely store complex passwords.

### 5. Account Management
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Restrict user permissions** | Assign only necessary privileges (principle of least privilege). |
| **Restrict log-in times** | Limit when users can access accounts. |
| **Disable guest account** | Remove unused accounts to reduce attack surface. |
| **Failed attempts lockout** | Temporarily lock accounts after repeated failed logins. |
| **Timeout / screen lock** | Automatically lock inactive sessions. |
| **Account expiration dates** | Set temporary accounts to expire automatically. |

### 6. Change Default Administrator Account / Password
- Rename default admin account and set a strong password.
- Prevent attackers from targeting known default credentials.

### 7. Disable AutoRun
- Stop automatic execution of removable media to prevent malware spread.

### 8. Disable Unused Services
- Turn off unnecessary services to minimize potential attack vectors.
- Examples: FTP, Telnet, print spooler if not required.
