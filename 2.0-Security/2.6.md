## ðŸ›  SOHO Malware Removal Procedures

### 1. Investigate and Verify Malware Symptoms
- Identify unusual system behavior: slow performance, pop-ups, crashes, unauthorized network activity.
- Confirm signs of infection using system logs, task manager, and antivirus alerts.

### 2. Quarantine Infected System
- Disconnect the system from the network to prevent malware spread.
- Limit external storage device access until the system is clean.

### 3. Disable System Restore in Windows Home
- Prevent malware from being saved in restore points.
- Path: **Control Panel > System > System Protection > Configure > Turn off system protection**.

### 4. Remediate Infected Systems
- Use anti-malware or antivirus tools to remove the threat.
- Follow vendor instructions for safe removal.
- Manually remove malware if automated tools fail.

### 5. Update Anti-Malware Software
- Ensure virus definitions and software are current before scanning.
- Regular updates improve detection of new threats.

### 6. Scan and Removal Techniques
- **Safe Mode**: Boot with minimal drivers to prevent malware from running.
- **Preinstallation Environment (WinPE)**: Scan offline for stubborn malware that prevents normal boot.
- Full system scans and targeted scans for critical areas.

### 7. Reimage / Reinstall
- If the system is heavily infected, back up essential data and perform a clean OS reinstall.
- Reimaging ensures all malware traces are removed.

### 8. Schedule Scans and Run Updates
- Set up automated scans to run regularly.
- Apply operating system and software updates to patch vulnerabilities.

### 9. Enable System Restore and Create a Restore Point
- Re-enable System Restore after cleaning to protect against future issues.
- Path: **Control Panel > System > System Protection > Configure > Turn on system protection > Create restore point**.

### 10. Educate the End User
- Teach safe computing practices:
  - Avoid suspicious links and attachments.
  - Keep software updated.
  - Use strong, unique passwords.
  - Recognize social engineering attempts.
