## ‚úÖ Objective 2.1 ‚Äì Summarize Various Security Measures and Their Purposes

### üéØ Introduction

This section prepares you for **Objective 2.1** of the **CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1202)** exam. IT professionals must understand and implement both physical and logical security measures to protect systems, data, and users from unauthorized access and potential threats.

## üõ°Ô∏è Physical Security Measures

| Security Method           | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Bollards**              | Physical barriers to prevent vehicle access. |
| **Access Control Vestibule** | Controlled access zone with two sets of doors (mantrap). |
| **Badge Reader**          | Scans ID badges to control entry. |
| **Video Surveillance**    | Monitors and records physical environments. |
| **Alarm Systems**         | Alerts for unauthorized access or breaches. |
| **Motion Sensors**        | Detect movement in restricted areas. |
| **Door Locks**            | Mechanical or electronic locks for restricted access. |
| **Equipment Locks**       | Secure physical devices (e.g., cable locks for laptops). |
| **Security Guards**       | On-site personnel to enforce security. |
| **Fences**                | Physical barriers around buildings or perimeters. |

## üö™ Physical Access Security Devices

| Device                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Key Fobs**              | Wireless keyless entry devices. |
| **Smart Cards**           | Physical cards with embedded chips for secure access. |
| **Mobile Digital Keys**   | Smartphone-based digital credentials. |
| **Keys**                  | Traditional mechanical entry tools. |
| **Biometrics**            | Biological verification systems: |
| - Retina Scanner          | Uses retina patterns to identify users. |
| - Fingerprint Scanner     | Matches stored fingerprint data. |
| - Palm Print Scanner      | Authenticates based on palm features. |
| - Facial Recognition      | Analyzes facial structure for identity verification. |
| - Voice Recognition       | Identifies individuals based on vocal patterns. |
| **Lighting**              | Improves visibility and deters unauthorized access. |
| **Magnetometers**         | Detect metal objects (e.g., weapons). |

## üîê Logical Security Measures

| Concept/Tool                     | Purpose |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| **Principle of Least Privilege** | Users only get access to what they need. |
| **Zero Trust Model**             | Trust no device or user by default, verify everything. |
| **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  | Define permissions for files, networks, or services. |
| **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** | Verifies identity using multiple methods: |
| - Email                          | Code sent via email. |
| - Hardware Token                 | Physical device for codes. |
| - Authenticator App              | Generates temporary codes (e.g., Google Authenticator). |
| - SMS                            | Text message-based codes. |
| - Voice Call                     | Codes via phone call. |
| - Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) | Temporary passcodes based on time. |
| - One-Time Password (OTP)        | Single-use passcodes. |
| **Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML)** | Enables single sign-on across services. |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)**         | One login for multiple systems or applications. |
| **Just-in-Time Access**          | Temporary elevated access for a short duration. |
| - **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** | Controls high-level user access. |
| **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** | Secures and manages mobile devices. |
| **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**   | Prevents sensitive data leaks. |
| **Identity Access Management (IAM)** | Centralized management of user identities. |
| **Directory Services**           | Centralized authentication and user info (e.g., Active Directory). |
