## ‚úÖ Objective 2.3 ‚Äì Compare and Contrast Wireless Security Protocols and Authentication Methods

### üéØ Introduction

This section prepares you for **Objective 2.3** of the **CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1202)** exam. IT professionals must understand the differences between wireless encryption standards and authentication methods used to protect networks and resources from unauthorized access.

## üì° Wireless Security Protocols & Encryption

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)** | Original Wi-Fi security protocol, used RC4 encryption. Considered completely insecure and obsolete. |
| **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)** | Successor to WEP, introduced TKIP for better security. Now outdated and vulnerable. |
| **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2)** | Uses AES encryption; replaced WPA and became the minimum standard for secure wireless networks. |
| **WPA3** | Successor to WPA2; offers stronger encryption, protection from brute-force attacks, and better security on open networks. |
| **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)** | Legacy encryption used in WPA; less secure than AES and now considered deprecated. |
| **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** | Modern and secure encryption standard used in WPA2 and WPA3 for strong wireless data protection. |
| **Open (No Security)** | No authentication or encryption; common in public hotspots but highly insecure. |

> üîê **Note:** WPA3 is more secure than WPA2, and AES is significantly more secure than TKIP. Avoid using WEP, WPA, or WPA2 with TKIP due to known vulnerabilities.

## üîê Wireless Authentication Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)** | Centralized AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) protocol; commonly used in enterprise Wi-Fi networks for secure user authentication. |
| **TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)** | Cisco-proprietary protocol used for centralized authentication, mostly in network device access; separates AAA functions. |
| **Kerberos** | Secure network authentication protocol using tickets; used primarily in Windows domain environments. |
| **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** | Combines two or more authentication factors: something you know (password), have (token), or are (biometric). Enhances login security across all access points. |
