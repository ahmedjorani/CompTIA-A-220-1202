## 💾 Backup Methods

| Backup Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Full Backup** | Copies all files and data to the backup storage. Provides complete recovery but requires more storage and time. |
| **Incremental Backup** | Backs up only files changed since the last backup of any type. Faster and uses less storage, but recovery requires all incremental backups plus the last full backup. |
| **Differential Backup** | Backs up files changed since the last full backup. Requires more storage than incremental, but recovery is faster (last full + differential). |
| **Synthetic Full Backup** | Combines previous full and incremental backups to create a new full backup without scanning all files again. |

## 🔄 Recovery Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **In-Place / Overwrite** | Restores files to their original location, overwriting existing data if necessary. |
| **Alternative Location** | Restores files to a different location to prevent overwriting or for testing purposes. |

---

## 🧪 Backup Testing

- **Frequency**: Regularly test backups to verify data integrity and ensure recovery procedures work correctly.  
- Include both automated and manual testing schedules.

## 🔁 Backup Rotation Schemes

| Scheme | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Onsite vs. Offsite** | Store backups onsite for quick recovery and offsite for disaster protection. |
| **Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS)** | Rotational scheme using daily (son), weekly (father), and monthly (grandfather) backups for long-term retention. |
| **3-2-1 Backup Rule** | Keep **3 copies** of data, on **2 different media types**, with **1 copy offsite** for redundancy and disaster recovery. |
