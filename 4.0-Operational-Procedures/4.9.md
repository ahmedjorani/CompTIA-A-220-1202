## üåê Remote Access Methods and Tools

| Method / Tool | Description | Security Considerations |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** | Native Windows protocol for accessing remote desktops. | Use strong passwords, network-level authentication, and VPNs; restrict access via firewall rules. |
| **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** | Encrypts network traffic to securely connect remote users to internal networks. | Require multi-factor authentication (MFA); ensure up-to-date encryption protocols. |
| **VNC (Virtual Network Computing)** | Cross-platform graphical desktop-sharing system. | Use strong authentication, tunneling over VPN or SSH to encrypt traffic. |
| **SSH (Secure Shell)** | Secure command-line access for Linux/macOS servers. | Use key-based authentication; disable root login; limit IP access. |
| **RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management)** | Centralized tool to monitor and manage endpoints remotely. | Ensure strong admin credentials, secure agent communications, and encrypted connections. |
| **SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments)** | Protocol for accessing virtual machines in Linux environments. | Encrypt sessions; restrict access to authorized users. |
| **WinRM (Windows Remote Management)** | Windows remote management service for scripting and automation. | Enable HTTPS, restrict listener IPs, and enforce authentication. |

## üõ† Third-Party Remote Access Tools

| Tool Type | Examples | Security Considerations |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| **Screen-sharing software** | TeamViewer, AnyDesk | Use MFA, limit access duration, avoid public networks. |
| **Videoconferencing software** | Zoom, Microsoft Teams | Enable waiting rooms, passwords, and meeting encryption. |
| **File transfer software** | FTP, SFTP, Dropbox | Prefer secure protocols (SFTP/FTPS); encrypt sensitive files. |
| **Desktop management software** | ManageEngine, SolarWinds | Ensure encrypted connections, least privilege access, and strong passwords. |
